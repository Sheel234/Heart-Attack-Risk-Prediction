# ðŸ’“ Heart Attack Risk Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of a heart attack in individuals based on various health indicators. It uses supervised learning techniques to analyze patient data and make accurate predictions, assisting in early diagnosis and preventive care.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally. Early prediction of heart attack risk can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to build a predictive model using patient data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., to assess the risk of a heart attack.

## âœ… Features

- Input patient health data to predict risk
- Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of feature importance and prediction results

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing is publicly available and includes features like:

- Age
- Sex
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Chest Pain Type
- ST Depression Induced by Exercise
- And more...

## ðŸ“Š Model Used

We experimented with several classifiers:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The best model was selected based on evaluation metrics.
